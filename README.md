# hello-world
this is my very first git


So I'm just learning Java for fun and possible future mobile development. I have a friend that actually works for GitHub so I'm pretty excited to use it as a resource. I have been involved in the support side of IT for quite a while, but I really would like to expand my coding skills. I took quite a lot of programming languages during school and I don't want to lose those.
